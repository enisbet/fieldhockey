	<h1>My Responsibilities</h1>
	<p>The UM Field Hockey team's season is normally every Fall. This year, due to COVID-19, their season will be postponed to the spring. I am excited to be attend the competitions Spring of 2021. Currently (Fall 2020), the team is practicing during their irregular offseason.</p>

	<p> Every weekday of the team's offseason, practice starts at 3pm and ends around 6pm. At practice, the team either completes drills or plays 11 v 11. I am instructed by the Assistant Coach which stats to take based on what drills they play that day. Common stats I take are: player possessions, unforced turnovers, goalies saves, shots on goal, and penalty corners.</p>

	<p> At the end of practice, I input the stats into a Google sheet that is shared by the team and coaches. I use this data to create meaningful graphs with Excel and Tableau to present to the team. These graphs help the coaches train the players in which stats they lack in. They also allow the players to easily understand their strengths and weaknesses so they can focus on improvement.</p>

	<p> From time to time I also work with 
		<a href = "https://www.spiideo.com/sports/field-hockey-video-analysis-software/"> Spiideo</a> to record and tag player possessions and fouls throughout a game. I expect to be using this platform more in depth when their season starts.</p>
