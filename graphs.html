		<img src = "imgs/pic3.png" alt = 'graph 3' class = "statspic3">
		<p class = "statstext3"> This column chart is helpful when the coaches want single out players who need to perform better in a specfic stat. It is also helpful for the players to see what they need to work on.</p>

		<p class = "statstext5">This Tableau line graph shows the team's goalies (Anna and Gillian) save %. A save % is (number of saves)/(number of goal attempts).

	<div class = "stats_six">
		<img src = "imgs/pic6.png" alt = 'graph 6' class = "statspic6">
		<p class = "statstext6">This is a graph that I currently update at every practice. A penalty corner (PC) is a penalty given against the defending team. Keeping track of penalty corners througout practice is important because they can result in the opposing team getting a goal. At a competition, the team will want to have the players who tend to give the least amount of PC's on the field.  </p>

		<img src = "imgs/pic8.png" alt = 'graph 8' class = "statspic8">
		<p class = "statstext8">This line graph for goals scored is beneficial to compare which player scores the most so the team can have their highest scorers on the field. I labeled the max number of each month so the graph is more clear. </p>

	<div class = "stats_nine">
		<img src = "imgs/pic9.png" alt = 'graph 9' class = "statspic9">
